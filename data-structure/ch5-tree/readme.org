* thread binary tree
Each leave node has two null pointers. try to make use of these null pointer. Let

- the left child ptr points to the inorder predecessor ptr.
- the right child ptr points to the inorder successor ptr.

It makes it easy to get the inorder travel in linear time, little faster than the
recursive method. Fit for the stack lack suitation.

  // first node's inorder predecessor and last node's inorder successor point to the head node.
